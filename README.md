### Gearswap files

Job luas are modified from [Mote's job files](https://github.com/Kinematics/GearSwap-Jobs) -- he deserves a ton of credit for his job luas and awesome libraries.

If you're new to Mote's, I highly recommend reading the [Kinematics wiki](https://github.com/Kinematics/GearSwap-Jobs/wiki) to find out how all the core functions and logic work.

All of these luas make use of sebyg666's addon [GearInfo](https://github.com/sebyg666/GearInfo).  You will need to sideload that to your Windower4 installation for haste detection and auto movement gear swapping to work.

All 'global' files are optional -- they contain keybinds and [send](https://docs.windower.net/addons/send/) commands to aid in multi-boxing.

Sorry, I only have luas for jobs that I personally play.  And my luas are tailored to my own personal play style and preferences.

Feel free to modify and share to your hearts' content, but please give credit to Mote and myself.

### Status Icons files

StatusIcons.zip is the currently maintained version of [Jeanpaul's Status Icons mod](http://ffxidats.caarrie.com/index.php?action=downloads;sa=view;down=1353).  Updates regularly take place immediately after game patches, if necessary.

### GearInfo UI update

UI_Updates.rar is a skin for sebyg666's addon [GearInfo](https://github.com/sebyg666/GearInfo) that increases legibility and decreases the addon's screen real estate.
