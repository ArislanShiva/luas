### Gearswap files

Job luas are modified from [Mote's job files](https://github.com/Kinematics/GearSwap-Jobs) -- he deserves a ton of credit for his job luas and awesome libraries.

If you're new to Mote's, I highly recommend reading the [Kinematics wiki](https://github.com/Kinematics/GearSwap-Jobs/wiki) to find out how all the core functions and logic work.

All of these luas make use of sebyg666's addon [GearInfo](https://github.com/sebyg666/GearInfo).  You will need to sideload that to your Windower4 installation for haste detection and auto movement gear swapping to work.

All 'global' files are optional.

Sorry, I only have luas for jobs that I personally play.  And my luas are tailored to my own personal play style and preferences.

Feel free to modify and share to your hearts' content.

### Status Icons files

StatusIcons.zip is the currently maintained version of [Jeanpaul's Status Icons mod](http://ffxidats.caarrie.com/index.php?action=downloads;sa=view;down=1353).  Updates regularly take place immediately after game patches, if necessary.

### GearInfo UI update

UI_Updates.rar is a skin for sebyg666's addon [GearInfo](https://github.com/sebyg666/GearInfo) that increases legibility and decreases the addon's screen real estate.
